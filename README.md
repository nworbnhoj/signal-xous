# Signal-Xous App

A work-in-progress towards a [Signal](https://signal.org/) client for [xous](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core#xous-core).


## Working Notes

The basic idea is to save all msg directly to the PDDB, and for the UI to traverse a subset of the msg's in the PDDB.

### Next Steps

- [x] develop xous [tls library](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/pull/394) to manage the explicit trust of CA Certificates
- [x] confirm tls connection Precursor <=> chat.signal..org [ xous shellchat `wlan on` `net tls probe chat.signal.org` `net tls test chat.signal.org` ]
- [x] confirm websocket connection Precursor <=> chat.signal.org
- [x] develop [xous chat library](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/pull/408) to provide a UI to interact with a Dialogue of Posts stored in the PDDB
- [x] resurvey Whisperfish, signal-cli & gurk for useful stuff (see useful below)
- [ ] link a Precursor to an existing Signal account
- [ ] sync messages with an individual recipient
- [ ] send a new message to an individual recipient
- [ ] register a Precursor as a Signal device
- [ ] enable Signal groups


### Useful

* [libsignal](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal#overview) contains platform-agnostic APIs used by the official Signal clients and servers, written in Rust, and released under [AGPL 3.0](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/blob/main/LICENSE).
* The [Whisperfish](https://github.com/whisperfish/whisperfish#whisperfish) project is a helpful working example of a Signal client developed in Rust on the official Signal libsignal API. Unfortunately Whisperfish has a `tokio` dependency. See also [libsignal-service-rs](https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs#libsignal-service-rs) and [Presage](https://github.com/whisperfish/presage#presage)
* There is also [Signal-Desktop](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop#signal-desktop) [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli#signal-cli) and [gurk](https://github.com/boxdot/gurk-rs#gurk-)
* A basic xous [websocket](https://github.com/nworbnhoj/xous-core/tree/websocket-lib/libs/websocket#readme) with tls support is available to connect with Signal servers.
* xous supports [qr-codes](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/08aac2c2854dc3cfa7c277ddce85c0b88c72378b/services/modals/src/tests.rs#L160-L168) to facilitate device registration
* xous supports [png image processing](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/pull/207) but the websocket would need to be extended to present as a `Reader`.


### Unknowns

#### libc dependencies

xous has only limited libc support

Running `cargo tree -e no-build -e no-dev` over `libsignal` and extracted the libc dependencies gives

```

```
* [device transfer](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/blob/main/rust/device-transfer/src/lib.rs) can probably be re-implemented without too much fuss
* [curve25519-dalek](https://crates.io/crates/curve25519-dalek) ... [getrandom](https://crates.io/crates/getrandom)
* [pqcrypto-kyber](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/blob/af7bb8567c812aa13625fc90076bf71a59d64ff5/rust/protocol/src/kem.rs#L426-L455) appears to be used only in tests
* [rand]() boils down to `use rand::{Rng, thread_rng, rngs::OsRng, prelude::*, distributions::Uniform, prelude::{Rng, ThreadRng}, RngCore, seq::SliceRandom}`

Hopefully the `getrandom` and `rand` dependencies are covered by the xous libc [rand](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/08aac2c2854dc3cfa7c277ddce85c0b88c72378b/services/ffi-test/sys/ffi/libc.c#L929-L975) implementation.
